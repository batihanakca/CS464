There are scripts for every coding problem seperately.
Everyone of them is the derivation of "Naive Bayes 4.4.py" with some little changes.

For running the codes just run the scripts and it will take 2 min approximately to print what it has done.
(HINT: Check working directory don't be like me)

For (4.4), (4.5) and (4.6) it prints the amount of true and wrong predictions and also the accuracy.

For (4.7) it prints the words for all labels

For (4.4), (4.5) and (4.6) code tooks true positive,true negative and true neutral prediction amount in variables true_neg, true_neut and true_pos

the scripts can work with the given test .csv and vocab .txt names for now (They have to be the same!)

'question-4-train-features'
'question-4-train-labels'
'question-4-test-features.csv'
'question-4-test-labels.csv'
'question-4-vocab'

to work with another test dataset (WITH THE SAME FORMAT !!) only thing should be done is:

changing the name of 'question-4-test-features.csv' in the line 108 with the new test data csv and
changing the name of 'question-4-test-labels.csv' in the line 114 with the new test data csv for (4.4) will work

for (4.5) lines are 112 and 118
for (4.6) lines are 108 and 114
